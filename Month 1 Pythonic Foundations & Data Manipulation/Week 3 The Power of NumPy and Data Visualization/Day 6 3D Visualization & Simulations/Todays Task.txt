Day 6: 3D Visualization & Simulations
Focus: Three-dimensional plotting and random simulations
Learning Goals:

3D plotting with mplot3d
Random number generation with NumPy
Simulation visualization

Projects:

3D Surface Plot - Visualize mathematical functions in 3D
Monte Carlo Pi Simulation - Estimate π using random sampling

Practice Tasks:

Use np.meshgrid() for 3D surfaces
Generate random numbers: np.random.rand(), np.random.randn()
Create animations (bonus)
