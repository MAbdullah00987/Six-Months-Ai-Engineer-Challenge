Day 3: Functions & Lambda + Shape Calculator
Learning Focus: Functions as objects, lambda, inheritance
Morning Study (1.5 hours):

Fluent Python: Chapter 3 & 7 (Dictionaries/Functions as Objects)
Coursera: Inheritance and Polymorphism module
Key concepts: Lambda functions, inheritance, super(), method overriding

Afternoon Project (2 hours):
Build: Shape Calculator
File structure:
- shapes/

  - base.py (Shape base class)
  - circle.py
  - rectangle.py
  - triangle.py
- main.py

Features:
- Base Shape class with color, name
- Child classes override calculate_area(), calculate_perimeter()
- Use lambda for simple calculations where appropriate
- Dictionary to store shape instances
Evening Portfolio (30 min):

Repo: "shape-calculator-inheritance"
Organize into modules (separate files)
Document inheritance hierarchy in README

Daily Goal: Understand inheritance and code organization
