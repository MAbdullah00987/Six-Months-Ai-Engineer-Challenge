Shape Calculator Project
Shape Calculator: Define a base Shape class and inherit from it to create Circle, Rectangle, etc., with methods to calculate area and perimeter.

Step-by-Step Explanation
Step 1: Understanding the Concept
This project demonstrates inheritance - one of the four pillars of OOP:

We create a base class (Shape) that defines common properties
Child classes (Circle, Rectangle, etc.) inherit from Shape and implement specific calculations
Each shape has its own way to calculate area and perimeter

Step 2: How Python Works in This Project
Key Python Concepts Used:

Classes and Objects

A class is a blueprint for creating objects
Objects are instances of classes


Inheritance

Child classes inherit properties and methods from parent classes
Syntax: class Child(Parent):


Method Overriding

Child classes can override parent methods with their own implementation


Abstract Methods (Optional)

Forces child classes to implement certain methods


The self Parameter

Refers to the instance of the class
Must be the first parameter in instance methods



Step 3: Project Structure
Shape (Base Class)
├── Circle (inherits from Shape)
├── Rectangle (inherits from Shape)
├── Square (inherits from Shape)
└── Triangle (inherits from Shape)

Detailed Breakdown of How Python Works Here
1. Import Statements
pythonimport math
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

math: Provides mathematical functions like pi, sqrt
ABC: Abstract Base Class - prevents direct instantiation
abstractmethod: Decorator to mark methods that MUST be implemented

2. The Base Class (Shape)
pythonclass Shape(ABC):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
How it works:

ABC makes Shape abstract - you can't create a Shape object directly
__init__ is the constructor - runs when creating an object
self.name is an instance variable - each object has its own name

3. Abstract Methods
python@abstractmethod
def area(self):
    pass
Why abstract methods?

Forces every child class to implement area() and perimeter()
If a child class doesn't implement these, Python raises an error
Ensures consistency across all shapes

4. Inheritance Syntax
pythonclass Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        super().__init__("Circle")
        self.radius = radius
How it works:

Circle(Shape) means Circle inherits from Shape
super().__init__("Circle") calls the parent's constructor
Circle gets all methods from Shape plus its own

5. Method Overriding
pythondef area(self):
    return math.pi * self.radius ** 2
How it works:

Circle provides its own implementation of area()
Overrides the abstract method from Shape
Each shape has different formulas

6. Object Creation and Usage
pythoncircle = Circle(radius=5)
circle.display_info()
```

**What happens:**
1. `Circle(radius=5)` calls `__init__`, creates object
2. Object stored in variable `circle`
3. `circle.display_info()` calls the inherited method
4. Inside `display_info()`, `self.area()` calls Circle's area method

## **Key Concepts Visualized**

### **Inheritance Flow:**
```
Shape (Parent)
  ├── name attribute
  ├── area() [abstract]
  ├── perimeter() [abstract]
  └── display_info() [concrete]
       ↓
Circle (Child) inherits everything above
  ├── radius attribute [new]
  ├── area() [implemented]
  ├── perimeter() [implemented]
  └── diameter() [new method]
Method Resolution Order (MRO):
When you call circle.display_info():

Python looks in Circle class - not found
Python looks in Shape class - found!
Executes Shape's display_info()
Inside it, calls self.area() - Python looks in Circle first, finds it!

How to Run the Project
Option 1: Run Complete Program
bashpython shape_calculator.py

Shows demonstrations
Provides interactive menu

Option 2: Use Individual Classes
python# In Python interactive shell or your own script
from shape_calculator import Circle, Rectangle

my_circle = Circle(10)
print(my_circle.area())  # Output: 314.159...
