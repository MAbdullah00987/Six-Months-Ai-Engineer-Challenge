Quiz Application Project
Project Overview
You'll build a quiz app with two main classes:

Question class - Represents individual quiz questions
Quiz class - Manages the entire quiz (questions, scoring, flow)


Step-by-Step Explanation
Step 1: Understanding the Question Class
The Question class stores:

The question text
Multiple answer choices
The correct answer

Why we need it: Each question is an object with its own data. This makes it easy to create, store, and check questions.
Step 2: Understanding the Quiz Class
The Quiz class manages:

A list of Question objects
The current score
Adding questions
Asking questions
Checking answers
Displaying results

Why we need it: It controls the entire quiz flow and keeps track of everything.
Step 3: How Python Works in This Project
Key Python Concepts Used:

Classes and Objects (OOP)

Classes are blueprints for creating objects
Objects are instances with their own data


Methods

Functions inside classes that operate on object data
Use self to access object attributes


Lists

Store multiple questions
Store answer choices

Input/Output

input() gets user responses
print() displays questions and results

Control Flow
if/else for checking answers
for loops for iterating through questions
How Python Works in This Project - Detailed Breakdown
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
class Question:
    def __init__(self, question_text, choices, correct_answer):
        self.question_text = question_text  # Instance variable

Classes define the structure
__init__ is the constructor (runs when creating an object)
self refers to the current object instance
Instance variables store data unique to each object

2. Creating Objects
q1 = Question("What is Python?", ["A", "B"], "B")

Creates a new Question object
Passes arguments to __init__
q1 now holds a Question with its own data

3. Methods (Functions in Classes)
def check_answer(self, user_answer):
    return user_answer.lower() == self.correct_answer.lower()

Methods operate on object data
Access instance variables using self
Can return values

4. Lists and Loops
for i, question in enumerate(self.questions, 1):
    question.display_question()

Lists store multiple Question objects
enumerate() gives both index and item
for loop iterates through each question

5. User Input and Validation
user_input = input("\nYour answer: ")
if user_input.isdigit():
    # Handle numeric input

input() gets user text
.isdigit() checks if input is a number
Validation ensures correct input format
How to Run the Project
Method 1: Run the Sample Quiz
python quiz_app.py
This runs the pre-made Python quiz with 5 questions.
Method 2: Create Your Own Quiz
After the sample quiz, you'll be asked if you want to create a custom quiz. Say "yes" and follow the prompts.
Method 3: Modify the Code
Add your own questions in the create_sample_quiz() function:
q6 = Question(
    "Your question here?",
    ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4"],
    "Correct answer here"
)
quiz.add_question(q6)

Key Features Explained
✓ Multiple Input Methods
Users can enter:

The number (1, 2, 3, 4)
The actual answer text

Instant Feedback
Shows whether each answer is correct/wrong immediately
Final Grading
Displays score, percentage, and letter grade at the end
Extensible Design
Easy to add more questions or create entirely new quizzes
