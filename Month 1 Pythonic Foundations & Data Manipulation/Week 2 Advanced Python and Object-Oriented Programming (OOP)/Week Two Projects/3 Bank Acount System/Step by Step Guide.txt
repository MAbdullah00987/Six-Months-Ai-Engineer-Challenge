                                                    Bank Account System - Complete Guide
Bank Account System: Use classes to model bank accounts with methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.

class BankAccount:
    """A class to represent a bank account with basic banking operations."""
    
    # Class variable to track all accounts
    total_accounts = 0
    
    def __init__(self, account_holder, account_number, 📚 Complete Step-by-Step Explanation
What is This Project?
This is a Bank Account Management System that simulates real banking operations using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It allows you to:

Create bank accounts
Deposit and withdraw money
Check balances
Transfer money between accounts
Track transaction history
Handle savings accounts with interest


How Python Works in This Project
1. Classes - The Blueprint 
What is a Class?
Think of a class as a blueprint for creating objects. Like a blueprint for a house, you can create many houses (objects) from one blueprint (class).
pythonclass BankAccount:
This creates a blueprint for bank accounts. Each account will have:

Account holder name
Account number
Balance
Transaction history


2. The __init__ Method - The Constructor 
What does it do?
This special method runs automatically when you create a new account. It sets up the initial values.
pythondef __init__(self, account_holder, account_number, initial_balance=0):
    self.account_holder = account_holder
    self.account_number = account_number
    self.balance = initial_balance
How it works:

self refers to the specific account being created
When you write: account1 = BankAccount("Alice", "ACC001", 1000)

self.account_holder becomes "Alice"
self.account_number becomes "ACC001"
self.balance becomes 1000




3. Instance Variables - Account Data 
pythonself.balance = initial_balance
self.transaction_history = []
What are these?

Each account object has its own data
self.balance stores how much money is in THIS specific account
self.transaction_history is a list that records all transactions

Example:

Alice's account has balance = 1000
Bob's account has balance = 500
They're separate and don't affect each other!


4. Methods - Actions You Can Perform 
a) Deposit Method
pythondef deposit(self, amount):
    if amount <= 0:
        print("Error: Amount must be positive!")
        return False
    
    self.balance += amount
    self.transaction_history.append(f"Deposit: +${amount:.2f}")
    return True
Step-by-step flow:

Check if amount is valid (must be positive)
Add money to balance: self.balance += amount
Record the transaction in history
Return True to show success

Example:
pythonaccount1.deposit(500)
# balance was 1000, now becomes 1500

b) Withdraw Method
pythondef withdraw(self, amount):
    if amount > self.balance:
        print("Insufficient funds!")
        return False
    
    self.balance -= amount
    return True
Key features:

Validation: Checks if you have enough money
Deduction: Subtracts from balance
Error handling: Returns False if insufficient funds


c) Transfer Method
pythondef transfer(self, recipient_account, amount):
    self.balance -= amount  # Take from sender
    recipient_account.balance += amount  # Give to recipient
How it works:

Takes another BankAccount object as parameter
Removes money from sender (self)
Adds money to recipient
Records transaction in both accounts


5. Class Variables - Shared Data 
pythonclass BankAccount:
    total_accounts = 0  # Shared by ALL accounts
Difference from instance variables:

Instance variable (self.balance): Each account has its own
Class variable (total_accounts): Shared by all accounts

Example:
pythonaccount1 = BankAccount(...)  # total_accounts = 1
account2 = BankAccount(...)  # total_accounts = 2

6. Inheritance - Creating Specialized Accounts 
pythonclass SavingsAccount(BankAccount):
    def __init__(self, ..., interest_rate=0.02):
        super().__init__(...)  # Call parent constructor
        self.interest_rate = interest_rate
What is inheritance?

SavingsAccount inherits ALL methods from BankAccount
Plus, it adds new features (interest rate)
super() calls the parent class's methods

Benefit:

No need to rewrite deposit/withdraw methods
Just add new functionality (apply_interest)


7. Special Methods - Magic Methods 
pythondef __str__(self):
    return f"BankAccount({self.account_holder}, Balance: ${self.balance})"
What it does:
When you print(account1), Python automatically calls __str__ to get a readable representation.

Complete Flow Example 🔄
Let's trace what happens when you run:
pythonaccount1 = BankAccount("Alice", "ACC001", 1000)
account1.deposit(500)
Step 1: Object Creation

Python creates a new object in memory
Calls __init__(self, "Alice", "ACC001", 1000)
Sets self.account_holder = "Alice"
Sets self.balance = 1000
Creates empty list for transaction_history

Step 2: Deposit Operation

Calls deposit(self, 500)
Checks: 500 > 0 Valid
Executes: self.balance += 500 → balance becomes 1500
Adds to history: "Deposit: +$500.00"
Prints success message
Returns True


Key Python Concepts Used 🎓
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Encapsulation: Data (balance) and methods (deposit/withdraw) bundled together
Abstraction: Hide complex logic, show simple interface
Inheritance: SavingsAccount extends BankAccount
Polymorphism: Same method names work differently for different account types

2. Error Handling
pythonif amount <= 0:
    print("Error!")
    return False
Validates input before performing operations
3. F-strings (Formatted Strings)
pythonprint(f"Balance: ${self.balance:.2f}")

{self.balance} inserts the value
:.2f formats to 2 decimal places

4. List Operations
pythonself.transaction_history.append("Deposit: +$500")
Dynamically adds transactions to history
5. Boolean Returns
pythonreturn True  # Success
return False  # Failure
Indicates whether operation succeeded

How to Use This System
Basic Usage:
python# Create an account
my_account = BankAccount("Your Name", "ACC123", 1000)

# Deposit money
my_account.deposit(500)

# Withdraw money
my_account.withdraw(200)

# Check balance
my_account.get_balance()

# View history
my_account.get_transaction_history()

# Transfer to another account
your_account = BankAccount("Friend", "ACC456", 500)
my_account.transfer(your_account, 100)

# Create savings account
savings = SavingsAccount("Saver", "SAV001", 5000, 0.03)
savings.apply_interest()  # Earn interest!
