Stack and Queue Data Structures in Python - Complete Guide
I'll explain these fundamental data structures step by step and create implementations for you.
What are Stacks and Queues?
Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out)
Think of a stack of plates - you add plates on top and remove from the top.

Real-world examples: Browser back button, undo/redo functionality, function call stack
Operations: Push (add), Pop (remove), Peek (view top)

Queue (FIFO - First In, First Out)
Think of a line at a store - first person in line gets served first.

Real-world examples: Print queue, customer service lines, task scheduling
Operations: Enqueue (add to back), Dequeue (remove from front), Peek (view front)

How Python Works in This Project
Key Python Concepts Used:

Classes and Objects - Blueprint for creating data structures
Lists - Python's built-in dynamic array (we'll use it internally)
Methods - Functions inside a class that operate on the data
self keyword - Refers to the instance of the class
Exception Handling - Managing errors (like removing from empty stack)
Magic Methods - __str__, __len__, __repr__ for better object representation

Step-by-Step Breakdown
How Python Works Here:
1. Class Definition
pythonclass Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

class creates a blueprint for Stack objects
__init__ is the constructor - runs when you create a new Stack
self.items is an instance variable that stores the stack's data

2. Methods (Functions Inside Class)
pythondef push(self, item):
    self.items.append(item)

self refers to the specific instance of the Stack
Each method can access self.items to modify the stack

3. Python List as Internal Storage

We use Python's built-in list to store items
append() adds to end: O(1) time
pop() removes from end: O(1) time
pop(0) removes from front: O(n) time (slower for queue)

4. Magic Methods
pythondef __str__(self):  # Makes print(stack) work
def __len__(self):  # Makes len(stack) work
Time Complexity Analysis
Operation       Stack    Queue(list)    Queue(deque)
Push/Enqueue     O(1)     O(1)           O(1)
Pop/Dequeue      O(1)     O(n)           O(1)
Peek             O(1)     O(1)           O(1)
How to Use This Code:
1. Run the complete demo:
python# Just run the file - it will show all examples
2. Create your own Stack:
pythonmy_stack = Stack()
my_stack.push("item1")
my_stack.push("item2")
top = my_stack.pop()  # Returns "item2"
3. Create your own Queue:
pythonmy_queue = Queue()
my_queue.enqueue("first")
my_queue.enqueue("second")
first = my_queue.dequeue()  # Returns "first"
