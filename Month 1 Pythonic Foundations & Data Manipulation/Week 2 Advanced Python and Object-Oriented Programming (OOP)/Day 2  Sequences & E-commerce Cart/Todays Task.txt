6 months of my AI Engineer Journey 
Week 2: Advanced Python & OOP (Day 2 Update)

Continuing my 6-month AI Engineer journey, I’ve now entered Week 2, where I’m exploring Advanced Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) — essential for writing clean, scalable, and efficient code.

I was a bit late covering Day 1, so I’m posting two updates today to stay consistent and keep better track of my learning progress. 💪

🎯 Day 2 Focus: Sequences & E-commerce Cart

🧠 Learning Focus:

Deepening understanding of list comprehensions and data structures

Practicing encapsulation, private attributes (_variable), and getters/setters

Strengthening my ability to write modular and Pythonic code

📚 Study Resources:

Fluent Python – Chapter 2 (Sequences) by Luciano Ramalho

Coursera – Python 3 Programming Specialization (University of Michigan): Classes & Encapsulation module

💻 Hands-on Project: Basic E-commerce Cart 🛒
Built a class-based shopping cart system featuring:

Product Class: name, price, stock quantity, category

ShoppingCart Class: items list, add_item() and remove_item() methods

Core methods: calculate_subtotal(), calculate_tax(), and apply_discount()

Implemented list comprehensions for efficient filtering and searching of products

Even though I’m catching up, what matters most is consistency and steady growth. Each concept I learn brings me closer to my goal of becoming a skilled AI Engineer — one step at a time. 🚀
