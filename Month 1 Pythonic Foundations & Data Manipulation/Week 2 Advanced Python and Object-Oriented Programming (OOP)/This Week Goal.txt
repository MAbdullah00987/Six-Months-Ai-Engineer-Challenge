Week 2: Advanced Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Weekly Objective: Write more efficient, reusable, and "Pythonic" code by mastering OOP and advanced language features.

Core Concepts: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, modules, packages, list comprehensions, lambda functions, error handling.

Primary Resources:

Book: Fluent Python, 2nd Edition by Luciano Ramalho (Chapters 1-8).   

Course: University of Michigan's "Python 3 Programming" on Coursera (Specialization).   

Weekly Project Ideas:

Bank Account System: Use classes to model bank accounts with methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.

Basic E-commerce Cart: Create Product and ShoppingCart classes to simulate adding items to a cart.

Shape Calculator: Define a base Shape class and inherit from it to create Circle, Rectangle, etc., with methods to calculate area and perimeter.

Custom Data Structure: Implement a Stack or Queue using a Python class.

Simple API Wrapper: Write a class that makes it easier to interact with a public API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).

Web Scraper Class: Encapsulate web scraping logic into a reusable class.

Personal Library Catalog: Use OOP to model Book and Library objects to manage a collection of books.

Quiz Application: Create Question and Quiz classes to build a command-line quiz.

Employee Management System: Design classes for Employee and Department to manage company data.

Refactor a Previous Project: Take a script from Week 1 and refactor it to use classes and objects.

Portfolio & Brand Building:

GitHub: Push your OOP projects to new repositories. Practice writing clear commit messages. Organize your code into modules (.py files) instead of just one large script.

LinkedIn: Add "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)" and "Python" to your skills section.
